FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
=======================

NEW FILES:
- src/services/customerAdvanceService.js (Main service handling customer creation & advance payments)
- database/migrations/flyway/V42__Create_advance_payments_table.sql (Database schema)
- docs/CUSTOMER-ADVANCE-SYSTEM.md (Comprehensive documentation)

MODIFIED FILES:
- src/services/bookingService.js (Updated to use new customer service)
- src/routes/appointments.js (Updated to use new customer service) 
- src/services/enquiryService.js (Updated to use new customer service)

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
==================

1. CUSTOMER CREATION:
   - Checks if customer exists by phone number (store-scoped)
   - Creates new customer if not found with all available details
   - Returns existing customer if phone number already exists
   - Generates unique referral codes for new customers

2. ADVANCE PAYMENT PROCESSING:
   - Updates customer.advance_amount with payment amount
   - Creates detailed record in advance_payments table
   - Links payment to original appointment/booking/enquiry
   - Supports multiple payment modes (cash, card, upi, wallet, bank_transfer)
   - Tracks payment references and metadata

3. ADVANCE UTILIZATION (for future billing):
   - FIFO deduction from available advance payments
   - Creates utilization records linking advances to bills
   - Automatically updates remaining amounts and status
   - Prevents over-utilization with balance checks

DATABASE SCHEMA ENHANCEMENTS:
============================

NEW TABLES:
- advance_payments: Comprehensive advance payment tracking
  * Links to customers, stores, and original transactions
  * Tracks amount, utilization, and remaining balance
  * Supports multiple payment modes and references

- advance_payment_utilizations: Bill-level utilization tracking
  * Links advance payments to specific bills
  * Enables detailed audit trail of usage
  * Automatic remaining amount calculation via triggers

ENHANCED TABLES:
- customers: Existing advance_amount field utilized
- customer_wallet_history: Enhanced with advance payment records

API INTEGRATION:
===============

APPOINTMENTS:
- POST /appointments/{storeId} now auto-creates customers
- Processes advanceAmount if provided
- Returns customer info and creation status

BOOKINGS: 
- POST /bookings/{storeId} now auto-creates customers
- Processes advance_amount if provided  
- Enhanced response with customer details

ENQUIRIES:

- Customer creation for future engagement

USAGE EXAMPLES:
==============

1. APPOINTMENT WITH NEW CUSTOMER + ADVANCE:
   Request: { phoneNumber: "+919876543210", customerName: "John", advanceAmount: 500 }
   Result: New customer created, ₹500 added to advance balance, linked to appointment

2. BOOKING WITH EXISTING CUSTOMER:
   Request: { country_code: "+91", contact_no: "9876543210", advance_amount: 300 }
   Result: Existing customer found, ₹300 added to advance balance (total: ₹800)

3. ENQUIRY WITH NEW CUSTOMER (NO ADVANCE):
   Request: { country_code: "+91", contact_no: "8765432109", name: "Jane" }
